user-mode-linuc (2.6.17-1um-2) unstable; urgency=low

  The Linux 2.6 kernel (and therefore the user-mode-linux kernel package) is
  significantly changed since the 2.4 series, some major issues you should be
  aware of:
  - DEVFS has been dropped upstream and is unsupported by this package, you
    should either install udev (if possible) or create a static /dev in your
    rootfs images if you relied on DEVFS before.
  - Kernel module loading changed and now the module-init-tools is needed in
    place of modutils.
  - UML 2.6.17 supports the new NTPL, an host kernel that supports it is
    necessary.
